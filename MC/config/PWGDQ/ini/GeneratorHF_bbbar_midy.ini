### The setup uses an external event generator
### This part sets the path of the file and the function call to retrieve it

### The external generator derives from GeneratorPythia8.
### This part configures the bits of the interface: configuration and user hooks

### The setup uses an external even generator trigger which is
### defined in the following file and it is retrieved and configured
### according to the specified function call

### The setup inhibits transport of primary particles which are produce at forward rapidity.
### The settings below only transports particles in the barrel, which is currently defined as |eta| < 2
